Description: cosinoRmixedeffects is a set of simple functions that transforms longitudinal
    data to estimate the cosinor linear model as described in Tong (1976).
    Methods are given to summarize the mean, amplitude and acrophase, to
    predict the mean annual outcome value, and to test the coefficients in mixed models.
